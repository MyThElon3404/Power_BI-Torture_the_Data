One of the most essential jobs a data analyst can carry out in Microsoft Power BI is creating a great data model. By executing this task effectively, you can make it simpler for others to comprehend your data, which will make it simpler for both you and them to create useful Power BI reports.

They may also provide details about data types and keys.
