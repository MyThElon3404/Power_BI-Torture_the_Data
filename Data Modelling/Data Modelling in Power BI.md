# **_Database normalization:_**
A set of guidelines and procedures for data modeling is called database normalization. You may compare it to creating or organizing a database.
- **Removing redundant data:** When the same data is kept in different locations, that is. File sizes can be reduced and inconsistent data can be avoided by reducing redundancy
- **Table relationships:** Table relationships are established using _primary and foreign keys_. Primary keys are the column(s) that uniquely identify each row of data that is not empty. The primary key is a shorthand term for the distinctive value that is given to each row. This process becomes important when you are referencing rows in a different table, which is what foreign keys do.

## **_Types of data models:_**  
The process will start with a conceptual model, progress to a logical model and conclude with a physical model

**1.**  **_Conceptual data models:_** They are also referred to as domain models and offer a big-picture view of what the system will contain, how it will be organized, and which business rules are involved. Conceptual models are usually created as part of the process of gathering initial project requirements

**2.**  **_Logical data models:_** They are less abstract and provide greater detail about the concepts and relationships in the domain under consideration. One of several formal data modeling notation systems is followed. These indicate data attributes, such as data types and their corresponding lengths, and show the relationships among entities. Logical data models don’t specify any technical system requirements

**3.**  **_Physical data models:_** They provide a schema for how the data will be physically stored within a database. As such, they’re the least abstract of all. They offer a finalized design that can be implemented as a relational database, including associative tables that illustrate the relationships among entities as well as the primary keys and foreign keys that will be used to maintain those relationships. Physical data models can include database management system (DBMS)-specific properties.
