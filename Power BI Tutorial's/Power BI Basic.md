## **Power BI** - Uncover powerful insights and turn them into impact
- Power BI is a part of Microsoft Power Platform and a proprietary Data Visualization and Business Intelligence platform. It is one of the widely used tools among organizations to analyze business data and generate reports. Power BI uses a collection of various in-built software services, apps, and connectors to deeply integrate with data to provide immersive visuals, interactive reports, and generate insights.

- Power BI helps users to aggregate, analyze, visualize, and share data. It is a SaaS (Software as a Service) based platform and is also available for Desktop, mobile, and on-premise servers. Power BI supports connection with many data source connectors to load data into the Dashboard directly from the data source and visualize data stored in Databases or Data Warehouses. Users use the Power BI Chart, graphs, KPIs, and reports to analyze the data and get interactive insights.

### **Power BI offers 2 services:**
1. **Power BI Desktop** - It is a free application that can be downloaded and installed on your local computer. Power BI Desktop is a comprehensive data analysis and report creation tool for connecting to, transforming, visualizing, and analyzing your data. It includes the Query Editor, which allows you to connect to a variety of data sources and combine them (also known as modeling) into a data model.  Then, based on that data model, you can design a report. Reports can be shared directly with others or by publishing to the Power BI service.

2. **Power BI Service** - It is a Cloud-based or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering of Power BI. It allows teams and organizations to edit reports and collaborate on them. Connecting to data sources in the Power BI service is also possible, but modelling is limited. The Power BI service is used to create dashboards, create and share apps, analyze and explore data to uncover business insights, and much more.
