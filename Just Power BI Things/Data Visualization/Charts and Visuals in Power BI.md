# **_Charts & Visualizations in Power BI_** ðŸ“Š

### **_Understanding Power BI Visualization:_**
- In Power BI, data visualization refers to the process of creating visual representations of data and information. This can be done using various chart types, such as column and bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, as well as other visual elements such as maps, scatter plots, and gauges. The goal of data visualization is to help users better understand and make sense of complex data by making it more accessible and intuitive. By using visual elements, data visualization allows users to see patterns and relationships in data that might not be immediately obvious from looking at raw numbers.

### **_Types of Power BI Visualizations:_**

- **Charts:** Charts are graphical representations of data in Power BI. Use them to simplify complex data sets and make it easier to understand and interpret the data. Power BI offers a variety of chart types.
  
**1.** _Area chart_ - It displays data points as a line, with the area between the line and the axis filled with color. Basic area charts help show trends over time or compare different categories of data.

**2.** _Stacked Area Chart_ - A stacked area chart shows multiple categories of data stacked on top of each other. This chart type is useful for showing how different categories contribute to a whole.

- **Bar Charts:** Bar charts are one of the most fundamental and widely used visualizations in Power BI. They are a simple and effective way to display categorical data, allowing users to compare and analyze data across different categories. Bar charts are ideal for showcasing quantitative data where the values are not too large.
  
**1.** _Clustered Bar Chart_ - This is the most common type of bar chart, where bars are grouped for each category, allowing for easy comparison of values within the same category.

**2.** _Stacked Bar Chart_ - In this chart, the bars are stacked vertically, representing the contribution of each category to a total value. This is useful for visualizing the composition of a whole and identifying the dominant categories.

**3.** _100% Stacked Bar Chart_ - Similar to the stacked bar chart, the bars always sum up to 100%, making it ideal for showing percentages and proportions.

- **Line Charts:** Power BI uses a line chart to visually represent data points connected by straight lines. Users employ it to visualize trends and patterns over time or across categories, making it ideal for continuous data such as time series data, stock market trends, sales figures, etc.

- **Pie Charts:** A pie chart is a circular chart divided into slices, where each slice represents a data category and its size corresponds to the percentage it contributes to the whole. Pie charts are best suited for visualizing data with a few categories (5-7 ideally) and highlighting the contribution of each category to the total.

**1.** _Simple Pie Chart_ - Displays a single data series with each slice representing a category.

**2.** _Doughnut Chart_ - Similar to a pie chart, but with a blank space in the center. This allows for additional information like a title or an image to be displayed within the chart.

- **Waterfall Charts:** A waterfall chart is a type of data visualization in Power BI that helps you understand how a starting value changes to an ending value through a series of intermediate values. Each intermediate value is represented by a bar that is stacked on top of the previous bar, creating a waterfall effect. This makes it easy to see the cumulative effect of each intermediate value on the outcome.

- **Funnel Charts:** A funnel chart is a type of data visualization in Power BI that is used to track the progress of a process or system over multiple stages. The stages are represented by a series of segments that are progressively smaller in size, resembling the shape of a funnel. The size of each segment represents the number of items that have reached that stage.

- **Scatter Charts:** A scatter chart in Power BI is a data visualization tool used to analyze the relationship between two numerical variables. It plots data points as dots on a graph, with the x-axis representing one variable and the y-axis representing the other. The position of each dot indicates the values of both variables for that data point.

- **Ribbon Charts:** A ribbon chart is a visual tool in Power BI that combines the features of a stacked column chart and a waterfall chart. It displays data in a series of connected bars or ribbons, where each ribbon represents a category or segment of the data. The width of each ribbon corresponds to the value of its category, and the ribbons are stacked on top of each other in descending order of value. This stacked layout allows you to easily compare the relative values of each category and identify the top performers.

- **Map Charts:** Map charts in Power BI are data visualizations that display information geographically, using maps as the visual canvas. They allow you to analyze spatial patterns and trends in your data, providing valuable insights into how location affects your business metrics.

- **Cards:** Card charts are data visualization elements in Power BI that display a single data point with a clear and concise format. They are often used to highlight key metrics, trends, and KPIs (key performance indicators).

- **Gauge Cards:** A gauge chart is a circular visualization primarily used to measure progress towards a specific goal or target. It visually represents the current value of a metric about a defined minimum and maximum range. This makes it easy to understand at a glance how close one is to achieving the desired outcome.

- **Matrix Cards:** A matrix chart in Power BI is a versatile visualization tool used to display and compare data across various categories and measures. It combines the functionality of a table and a chart, offering a concise and interactive way to analyze complex datasets.
