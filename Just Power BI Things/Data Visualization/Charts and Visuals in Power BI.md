# **_Charts & Visualizations in Power BI_** ðŸ“Š

### **_Understanding Power BI Visualization:_**
- In Power BI, data visualization refers to the process of creating visual representations of data and information. This can be done using various chart types, such as column and bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, as well as other visual elements such as maps, scatter plots, and gauges. The goal of data visualization is to help users better understand and make sense of complex data by making it more accessible and intuitive. By using visual elements, data visualization allows users to see patterns and relationships in data that might not be immediately obvious from looking at raw numbers.

### **_Types of Power BI Visualizations:_**

- **Charts:** Charts are graphical representations of data in Power BI. Use them to simplify complex data sets and make it easier to understand and interpret the data. Power BI offers a variety of chart types.
  
**1.** _Area chart_ - It displays data points as a line, with the area between the line and the axis filled with color. Basic area charts help show trends over time or compare different categories of data.

**2.** _Stacked Area Chart_ - A stacked area chart shows multiple categories of data stacked on top of each other. This chart type is useful for showing how different categories contribute to a whole.

- **Bar Charts:** Bar charts are one of the most fundamental and widely used visualizations in Power BI. They are a simple and effective way to display categorical data, allowing users to compare and analyze data across different categories. Bar charts are ideal for showcasing quantitative data where the values are not too large.
  
**1.** _Clustered Bar Chart_ - This is the most common type of bar chart, where bars are grouped for each category, allowing for easy comparison of values within the same category.

**2.** _Stacked Bar Chart_ - In this chart, the bars are stacked vertically, representing the contribution of each category to a total value. This is useful for visualizing the composition of a whole and identifying the dominant categories.

**3.** _100% Stacked Bar Chart_ - Similar to the stacked bar chart, the bars always sum up to 100%, making it ideal for showing percentages and proportions.

- **Line Charts:** Power BI uses a line chart to visually represent data points connected by straight lines. Users employ it to visualize trends and patterns over time or across categories, making it ideal for continuous data such as time series data, stock market trends, sales figures, etc.
