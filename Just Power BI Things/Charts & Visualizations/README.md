# **_Charts & Visualizations in Power BI_** ðŸ“Š
- In Power BI, data visualization refers to the process of creating visual representations of data and information. This can be done using various chart types, such as column and bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, as well as other visual elements such as maps, scatter plots, and gauges. The goal of data visualization is to help users better understand and make sense of complex data by making it more accessible and intuitive. By using visual elements, data visualization allows users to see patterns and relationships in data that might not be immediately obvious from looking at raw numbers.
