## **Power BI** - Uncover powerful insights and turn them into impact

- Power BI is a part of Microsoft Power Platform and a proprietary Data Visualization and Business Intelligence platform. It is one of the widely used tools among organizations to analyze business data and generate reports. Power BI uses a collection of various in-built software services, apps, and connectors to deeply integrate with data to provide immersive visuals, interactive reports, and generate insights.

- Power BI helps users to aggregate, analyze, visualize, and share data. It is a SaaS (Software as a Service) based platform and is also available for Desktop, mobile, and on-premise servers. Power BI supports connection with many data source connectors to load data into the Dashboard directly from the data source and visualize data stored in Databases or Data Warehouses. Users use the Power BI Chart, graphs, KPIs, and reports to analyze the data and get interactive insights.

### **Power BI offers 2 services:**

1. **Power BI Desktop** - It is a free application that can be downloaded and installed on your local computer. Power BI Desktop is a comprehensive data analysis and report creation tool for connecting to, transforming, visualizing, and analyzing your data. It includes the Query Editor, which allows you to connect to a variety of data sources and combine them (also known as modeling) into a data model.  Then, based on that data model, you can design a report. Reports can be shared directly with others or by publishing to the Power BI service.

2. **Power BI Service** - It is a Cloud-based or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering of Power BI. It allows teams and organizations to edit reports and collaborate on them. Connecting to data sources in the Power BI service is also possible, but modelling is limited. The Power BI service is used to create dashboards, create and share apps, analyze and explore data to uncover business insights, and much more.

### **Key Components of Power BI:**

1. **Power Query** - The data transformation and mashup engine are Power Query. It allows you to discover, connect, integrate, and enhance data sources to meet your analysis needs.
2. **Power Pivot** - Power Pivot is a data modeling method that allows you to develop data models, relationships, and calculations. Using the Data Analysis Expression (DAX) language, it models simple and complex data.
3. **Power View** - Excel, Sharepoint, SQL Server, and Power BI all include Power View. It allows you to build interactive charts, graphs, maps, and other graphics that help you visualize your data. It can connect to data sources and filter data for each data visualization element or the complete report.
4. **Power Map** - Power Map for Excel and Power BI is a 3-D data visualization tool from Microsoft that allows you to map and plot more than a million rows of data visually on Bing maps in 3-D format from an Excel table or Data Model in Excel.
5. **Power BI Desktop** - Power BI Desktop is a Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power View development tool. With Power BI Desktop, you have everything in one place and can quickly build BI and data analysis skills.
6. **Power BI Service** - The Power BI Service is a Cloud-based or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering of Power BI. It allows teams and organizations to edit reports and collaborate on them.
7. **Power Q&A** - Power BI’s Q&A tool lets you explore your data on your terms. It’s the quickest way to receive a natural-language answer from your data.

1. **Data Sources** - In Power BI, a data source refers to the entity from which data is extracted to generate reports and visualizations. This source can be a file, webpage, database, or another application or service.
Power BI accommodates both local and cloud-based data sources, allowing connections to sources on the same computer/server as well as those stored in other servers (cloud). These connections enable the extraction of necessary data.
