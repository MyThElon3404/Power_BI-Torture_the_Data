# **_Dax in Power BI_** -> Data Analysis Expressions

- DAX stands for Data Analysis Expressions, it is a language developed by Microsoft to interact with data in a variety of platforms like Power BI, PowerPivot, and SSAS tabular models. It is designed to be simple and easy to learn while exposing the power and flexibility of tabular models. In a way, you could compare it with Excel formulas on steroids. Using DAX will truly unleash the capabilities of Power BI.

- Data Analysis Expressions, or DAX for short, are expressions and formulas for analyzing and calculating data. Expressions like this are made up of various parts, such as functions, operators, and constants, all combined into a single formula and evaluated to provide a result (value or values). Power BI and other BI tools make excellent use of the data at their disposal, and the DAX formulae they contain are a big reason.

### **_Why Learn DAX:_**
- New Power BI Desktop files can be made and data imported with little effort. You don’t even need to know DAX to make reports displaying actionable insights. But what if you need to examine growth rates for several merchandise types and time intervals? Or perhaps you’re trying to figure out how to compare your company’s growth rates with the market as a whole; this functionality, among many others, is provided by DAX formulas. Writing efficient formulas will allow you to use your information better. Once you have all the facts, you can start fixing the issues plaguing your company’s bottom line.
