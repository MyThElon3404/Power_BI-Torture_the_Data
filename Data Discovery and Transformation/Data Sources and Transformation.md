# **_Data Sources and Data Transformation in Power BI:_**
### **_Data Sources:_** 
- Power BI is built around data. Power BI is a proprietary Data Visualization and Business Intelligence platform. It is one of the most widely used tools in organizations for analyzing business data and producing reports. Users can use Power BI to aggregate, analyze, visualize, and share data. The underlying data for the visualizations and answers in Power BI comes from a dataset. And that dataset is obtained from a data source.

## **_Data Transformation:_**
- With Power BI Desktop, you can connect to many different types of data sources, and then shape the data to meet your needs, enabling you to create visual reports to share with others. Shaping data means transforming the data: renaming columns or tables, changing text to numbers, removing rows, setting the first row as headers, and so on. Combining data means connecting to two or more data sources, shaping them as needed, and then consolidating them into a single query.

The transformation steps discussed in this section can be performed in any order after importing data into the Power BI Query Editor. To import the data, you can follow the steps mentioned below:

- Step 1: You can go to the “Home” tab in the ribbon section and click on “Get Data” to provide you with the option to source the data from a different platform.
- Step 2: Since you have your unsorted data in Excel, choose “Excel” from the menu.

- Step 3: This will open up a window to choose the “Excel file” that you wish to upload from your device. Next, the Navigator page prompts you to select the datasheets that you wish to work with. You can accordingly check to mark the sheets you want to. Since the primary aim was to sort the data, you can go with the “Transform Data” option. You can click on Load to upload the file without any transformation.

- Step 4: The Power BI Transform Data button will then take you to another window, also known as the Power BI Power Query Editor, where you will be transforming and cleaning your data.
