# **_Data Discovery and Data Sources in Power BI:_**
Data discovery is not a tool. It is a business user-oriented process for detecting patterns and outliers by visually navigating data or applying guided advanced analytics. Discovery is an iterative process that does not require extensive upfront model creation. 

We cluster it into three main categories:
- data preparation;
- visual analysis; and
- guided advanced analytics -> https://bi-survey.com/data-discovery

Data discovery requires skills in understanding data relationships and data modeling as well as in using data analysis and guided advanced analytics functions to reveal insights.

# **_Data Sources:_**
Power BI is built around data. Power BI is a proprietary Data Visualization and Business Intelligence platform. It is one of the most widely used tools in organizations for analyzing business data and producing reports. Users can use Power BI to aggregate, analyze, visualize, and share data. The underlying data for the visualizations and answers in Power BI comes from a dataset. And that dataset is obtained from a data source. The data sources that can be connected to Power BI to create dataflow are the Power BI Data Sources.

# **_Data Transformation and Cleansing:_**
Process of converting the extracted raw data into a certain standard that can be used for creating a data model and reporting.

- Cleaning, sorting, and filtering operations
- Feature engineering and selection
- Bringing a column to a specific standard
