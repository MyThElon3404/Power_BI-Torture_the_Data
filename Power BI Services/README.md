# **_Power BI Services_**
- Power BI is a cloud-based suite of business analytics tools that lets anyone connect to, visualize, and analyze data The Microsoft Power BI service (https://app.powerbi.com) is the Software as a Service (SaaS) part of Power BI. The Power BI service lets you consume and interact with reports, as well as individual visual elements found in those reports, right from your browser. Dashboards in the Power BI service help you keep a finger on the pulse of your business.
- In a typical Power BI workflow, you begin by building a report in Power BI Desktop, then publishing it to the Power BI service. This workflow is common, but you can also create Power BI reports right in the Power BI service.
